# Golang-Distributed-Counter

Hello world of distributed systems. 
Yes, we are talking about distributed counter. 
ðŸ˜› Attempt to write the distributed counter in go using CRDTs, because otherwise it would be even harder. 
This repo is just for learning purpose and not as a production ready code, but will try to achieve as close to it as possible. 
Plan to use this repository to learn multiple tools and ideologies such as distributed tracing, observability etc.
